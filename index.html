            Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, widely known as the "Missile Man of India" and
             the "People's President," was a renowned Indian scientist and politician who served
              as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in 
              Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he was the son of a boat owner and a homemaker. Despite 
              modest beginnings, Kalam's academic and professional journey is an inspiring story
